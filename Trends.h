 * Author   : brinkmwj
 * Date     : 2009-10-04
 * Sources  : All code is original
 * Purpose  : This class is designed to be an "Interface." Your trends data structure should be
 *            a sub-class of this class, but you should not implement this class. Instead, you should
 *            create a <uniqueid>Trends class, in the files <uniqueid>Trends.h and <uniqueid>Trends.cpp
 *            Declare your class (in your <uniqueid>Trends.h) like this:
 *  class brinkmwjTrends : public Trends {
 *    // declaration of member variables and methods here
 *  };
 *            In your class you should declare all of your methods to be virtual: This is how
 *            polymorphism is accomplished in C++. Do NOT copy the part that says "= 0" that I use
 *            below. That part means that the function, though declared, will not have any implementation.
 * Note     : DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE!!!

 *  class for your own data structure. You should make a .h and .cpp for you data structure ... in my
